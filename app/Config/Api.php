/**
 * API configuration for the Event Domain.
 *
 * Inherits every env-driven default (rate limiting, search, pagination, file
 * uploads, monitoring, outbound HTTP, API versions) from
 * `dcardenasl\Ci4ApiCore\Config\Api` — see that class for the full property
 * list and the environment variables that hydrate it. Add overrides here only
 * for tuning that is genuinely specific to this app.
 *
 * NOTE on the inherited JWT properties (`$jwtSecretKey`, `$jwtAccessTokenTtl`,
 * `$jwtRefreshTokenTtl`, `$jwtRevocationCheck`, `$jwtServiceTokenTtl`): this app
 * neither issues nor verifies JWTs — it delegates token introspection to the hub
 * through `DomainAuthFilter` → `HubClient::introspect()`. Those properties exist
 * because the same base config also serves the hub. Setting `JWT_SECRET_KEY` in
 * this app's environment has no effect; do not do it.
