> **Status:** initial Teatro Museo integration — Spanish version: [README.es.md](README.es.md)

CodeIgniter 4 domain application for Teatro Museo event programming and operations. It owns its business logic and database, but **delegates authentication, users, and IAM to the central API** (`teatromuseo-api`).

The registered hub application code is **`event`**. The plural `events` is reserved for the resource namespace and database tables.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Client["Browser / SPA"]
    Domain["Domain App<br/>(this repo) :8193"]
    Hub["Hub<br/>(teatromuseo-api) :8180"]
    DDB[("Domain DB<br/>business tables")]
    HDB[("Hub DB<br/>users · roles · perms")]

    Client -->|"Bearer JWT"| Domain
    Domain -.->|"POST /auth/introspect<br/>(cached per JTI, TTL 60s)"| Hub
    Domain -.->|"POST /auth/service-token<br/>(cached until expiry)"| Hub
    Domain --- DDB
    Hub --- HDB
```

Solid arrows = traffic on every request. Dashed = upstream calls to the hub, both cached.

The split:

- The **hub** issues JWTs, owns the `users` / `roles` / `permissions` tables, and resolves effective permissions per `(user, application)`.
- The **domain app** validates incoming JWTs by calling `POST /api/v1/auth/introspect` on the hub, then enforces permissions locally with the `permission:<code>` filter.
- The domain app **never** stores users, never issues JWTs, never reads the hub's database directly.

## Teatro Museo boundary

This domain owns operational programming rather than editorial content:

- `events` represents a scheduled activity such as a function, festival session, course, or workshop.
- `ticket_types`, `bookings`, and `tickets` provide the optional capacity and access-control layer.
- Editorial descriptions and page composition remain in `teatromuseo-cms-domain`; museum objects remain in `teatromuseo-catalog-domain`.
- Cross-domain links use identifiers or references, never database foreign keys across repositories.

## Quick start

```bash
./init.sh
# Prompts for: hub URL, X-App-Key, app code, DB credentials, optional superadmin JWT.
# Runs: composer install → migrate → domain:sync-permissions.

php spark serve --port 8193
```

Default port is **8193** to avoid colliding with the hub on `:8180` and the admin on `:8182`.

### Hub coordinates required

Before `init.sh` can finish, the hub must already have:

1. An `applications` row with `code = <hub.appCode>` you'll set here.
2. An API key bound to that application (`php spark apps:bootstrap <code>` on the hub side).
3. *(For the first permission sync only)* a superadmin JWT — service tokens cannot satisfy `iam.superadmin-access`. Get one via `POST /api/v1/auth/login` on the hub with superadmin credentials.

If any of these are missing, `domain:sync-permissions` will fail with a clear message; it is idempotent and safe to re-run.

---

## What's in the box

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `App\Filters\DomainAuthFilter` (alias `domainauth`) | Replaces local JWT validation. Calls `HubClient::introspect()` and injects `(uid, permissions[])` into the request context. |
| `App\Libraries\Hub\HubClient` | Single point of contact with the hub. Handles introspection caching (per JTI) and service-token caching with safety-margin refresh. |
| `App\Commands\SyncPermissions` (`php spark domain:sync-permissions`) | Registers the permissions in `Config\DomainPermissions` with the hub via `POST /api/v1/iam/permissions`. Idempotent. |
| `App\Config\DomainPermissions` | Declarative source of truth for the permissions this app owns. |
| `App\Config\Scaffolding` override | `make-crud` generates routes already wrapped in `domainauth + permission:<code> + throttle`. |
| `App\Models\BaseAuditableModel` + `Auditable` trait | Local audit logs persisted in this app's `audit_logs` table. |
| Inherited hardening | Security headers, correlation IDs, idempotency keys, deprecation headers, RFC 7807 problem details, maintenance mode filter, JSON file logging, request logs / metrics / queue infra. |

## What's NOT in the box

This is a domain app, not the hub. The following are **out of scope** here and live in the hub instead:

- `users` / `roles` / `permissions` tables and admin endpoints (`/api/v1/iam/*`)
- Login, logout, password reset, email verification, Google OAuth
- JWT issuance and refresh
- File storage drivers (S3, local) — re-add as a domain-specific module if a particular domain needs it

---

## Common commands

```bash
# Dev server
php spark serve --port 8193

# Database
php spark migrate                    # Local migrations only — never touches the hub DB
php spark tests:prepare-db           # Sync the test DB before feature tests

# Hub permission sync (idempotent — safe to rerun)
php spark domain:sync-permissions --admin-token=<jwt>     # or set hub.adminToken in .env

# Tests
vendor/bin/phpunit                   # All
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit        # Fast, no DB
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Integration # DB-level
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature     # HTTP endpoints (requires tests:prepare-db)

# Quality gates
composer quality                     # PHPStan level 8 + PHPUnit + cs-check
composer cs-fix                      # Auto-fix style — run before committing

# OpenAPI
php spark swagger:generate
```

### Adding a new CRUD module

Use the shell wrapper (non-TTY-safe — `php spark make:crud` directly hangs in CI / Claude Code):

```bash
bash vendor/bin/make-crud.sh Item Example 'name:string:required|searchable,description:text' yes
php spark migrate
pkill -f 'spark serve'; php spark serve --port 8193 &     # routes are not hot-reloaded
php spark swagger:generate
```

The generator emits routes already wrapped in `domainauth + permission:items.read + throttle`. Adjust the per-verb permission codes if read and write should diverge.

When the module grows beyond flat CRUD, use the documented aggregate-extension pattern instead of forcing everything into the generated shape: [`docs/architecture/EXTENSION_GUIDE.md`](docs/architecture/EXTENSION_GUIDE.md).

### Adding a new permission

1. Append it to `app/Config/DomainPermissions.php::PERMISSIONS`.
2. Run `php spark domain:sync-permissions` — registers it with the hub (idempotent).
3. In the hub admin panel, attach the new permission to the role(s) that should carry it.
4. Reference the code in your route filter: `permission:items.archive`.

> **Permission separator is `.`, never `:`** — CI4's filter parser splits on `:` for arguments and silently truncates `permission:items:archive` to `permission:items`. See `TASKS.md` ⇒ "Architecture contracts".

## Configuration

Required environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hub.url` | Base URL of the hub (e.g. `http://localhost:8180`) |
| `hub.apiKey` | `X-App-Key` bound to this app's `applications` row in the hub |
| `hub.appCode` | Application code as registered in the hub |
| `hub.introspectCacheTtl` | *(optional)* Introspect-response cache TTL in seconds, default `60` |
| `hub.adminToken` | *(optional)* Superadmin JWT for `domain:sync-permissions` — prefer the `--admin-token` flag for one-shot use |
| `database.default.*` | This app's own MySQL connection |
| `encryption.key` | CI4 encryption key (32 bytes after `hex2bin:` decode) |

> **Tokens are server-side only.** Pass them via `Authorization: Bearer …` headers (SPA) or PHP sessions (server-rendered admin). Never store JWTs in `localStorage` or non-HttpOnly cookies.

## Architecture

DTO-first layered pipeline, identical in shape to the hub:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Controller --> RequestDTO["[ RequestDTO ]<br/>auto-validates"]
    RequestDTO --> Service
    Service --> Model
    Model --> Entity
    Entity --> ResponseDTO["[ ResponseDTO ]"]
    ResponseDTO --> ApiResponse["ApiResponse envelope"]
```

Each step has one job: `RequestDTO` validates inputs at construction, `Service` runs pure business logic (DTO in, DTO out, transactional via `HandlesTransactions`), `Model` does persistence, `Entity` is the row, `ResponseDTO` is the contract emitted to clients. `ApiController::handleRequest()` orchestrates the wiring with no boilerplate.

The base classes (`ApiController`, `BaseCrudService`, `BaseRequestDTO`, `BaseAuditableModel`, the audit chain, the `HandlesTransactions` trait, the `ApiException` family) live in the [`dcardenasl/ci4-api-core`](https://packagist.org/packages/dcardenasl/ci4-api-core) package and are imported from the `dcardenasl\Ci4ApiCore\…` namespace. The domain template only contains domain-specific code; runtime upgrades happen by bumping the package constraint in `composer.json`.
